All of the presentations from Matlab Expo 2018 Turkey. Which is the first Matlab Expo in Turkey. This files are only accessible through people who went to expo. So we are lucky that I was there :)
Our main reference represantations are;

/Matlab Expo Presentations/Main Room/What’s New in MATLAB and Simulink - Nilgün Sever _ Mohammad Aziziaghdam, FİGES.pdf (you can see page 30 for exactly the application for our project topic "mapping")

/Matlab Expo Presentations/Artificial Intelligence Track/{Demystifying Deep Learning - Nilgün Sever, FİGES.pdf, Deploying Deep Learning Networks to Embedded GPUs and CPUs - Rainer Muemmler, MathWorks.pdf, Unlocking the Power of Machine Learning - Rainer Muemmler, MathWorks.pdf}

Deploying Deep Learning Networks to Embedded GPUs and CPUs - Rainer Muemmler presentation is another direct reference presantation.

Details and simplifications can be discussed on issues tab.
